# Statues Mod #

## About ##
Expanding the idea of OpenBlocks Trophies.

## Contributions ##
Localization contributors can choose to get the Translator cosmetic effect on their player statues.

At this time we will not accept PR's that add new missing vanilla mobs as Shy would like to make all the models/textures herself.
